- The application seeks to provide an immutable record for energy generation within a microgrid-enabled residence

- Focused on households under power-purchase agreement (PPA). Given the leaps and bounds needed to implement such in a blockchain setting, it is clear that further use-cases are needed

- EnergyChain provides an avenue for virtual grid-service aggregation (GSA) of distributed energy assets. 

- Household will be buying energy from PPA regardless, give them an option to sell back to the market. Make back money, and provide support the grid. 

- Clear and no-nonsense access to information regarding PPA and GSA via the blockchain data storage system which ensures each party maintains the same ledger and properly meets agreement with ond and another.
